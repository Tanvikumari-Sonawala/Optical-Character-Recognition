# Optical-Character-Recognition
Optical character recognition is the mechanical or electronic conversions of images, texts, handwritten or printed into machine coded text. When you read words on the computer screen, your eyes and brain are doing the work of OCR. Your eyes recognize words, images, colors, patterns, etc. Your eyes act like the scanner by scanning whole group words at the same time. Computers can do this too but not as quickly as the human eyes. Computers need to work harder than humans to scan any document, text, etc. So if you want a computer to read an old book or text, you need to present it with a picture of that page which is generated with an optical scanner. Pages created through the scanner are in the graphics file usually in JPG format. Whether it is a picture of a page or Eiffel tower itâ€™s completely meaningless for a computer if it is not scanned. To convert all the paper documents in computer readable format, you need scan all the docs with a good scanner.
